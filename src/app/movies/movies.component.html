      <!-- used routerLink to access route to MovieDetailComponent,
           in routes.ts i need 'movies:id', now i get two params, movies + movie.id -->
           
      <app-movie-list [routerLink]="['/movies', movie.id]" 
      class="col-md-4 borderless pointer" 
      *ngFor="let movie of movies" 
      [movie]="movie"></app-movie-list>

      <!-- ngFor let movie of movies iterates one item, next item etc. (movie reads property id from movies)
           let movie (from movie-list.component that it's html is repeatly showing instances of movies that are declared in movies.component')
           I think it works that way. But movie-list.component needs @Input value, i'm pushing movie.title, image to movie-list.component.html.
           Why it's [movie]="movie" here? It makes instances of array objects movies, but i think my @Input needs reference to this [movie].
           and my !! movie !! of movies passing others params to [movie]-->
